# Installs the ESP32 IR Remote daemon as a Windows Service.
#
# The equivalent of Linux's postinst plus the unit file, minus a package
# manager. This is the "sc create now, MSI at first release" step from the
# brief: enough to install, upgrade and remove the daemon across the machines it
# is being tested on, not enough to hand to somebody else.
#
# Run from an elevated PowerShell. Windows client defaults to an execution
# policy of Restricted, under which no .ps1 runs at all, so the bypass is not
# optional — and -Scope Process confines it to that one shell rather than
# changing the machine:
#
#   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
#   .\install-service.ps1 -BinaryPath C:\path\to\esp32-ir-daemon.exe
#
# Or without touching policy at all, from an elevated prompt:
#
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install-service.ps1 `
#              -BinaryPath C:\path\to\esp32-ir-daemon.exe
#
# Re-running it on a machine that already has the service is an upgrade: the
# running service is stopped and removed before the new one is created. That
# matters because this is installed and reinstalled repeatedly while the three
# power models are being worked through, and an installer that only works on a
# clean machine is one that stops working on exactly the second attempt.
#
# Uninstall:
#   .\install-service.ps1 -Uninstall
#   .\install-service.ps1 -Uninstall -RemoveLogs
#
# That this needs a policy bypass at all is part of why the brief lists an MSI
# as the real answer: an installer a user has to disarm the shell to run is not
# something to hand to anybody else.

# daemon is known to work, mirroring Linux, which ran as root until it did and

# scheme setting was not enough — a per-device value overrides it, and on a
# laptop the AC and DC values are separate, so a scheme change made on battery
# power silently does nothing.
